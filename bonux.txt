1) Refresh Button
Added a Refresh button and provided api/deleteAll to remove all the food from the database.
This is useful since in a single click all values can be deleted from database and it is useful when a new customer comes for the order.
Hence manual deletion of entries is replaced by a single click.

2) UI changes
Food as well as price has been displayed on UI so that user knows which food has what price.

3) Total (with 7.5% tax)
Total keeps on updating as an when item is added or deleted.

Note : Negative price is also accepted since it helps user to undo the price a food.
